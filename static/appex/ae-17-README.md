AE 17 for October 19 lecture

### Simulation set-up

1. A regular deck of cards is comprised of 52 cards:
    - Face cards: 4 aces, 4 jacks, 4 queens, and 4 kings
    - Non-face cards: 4 of numbers 2-10

2. Take out two aces from the deck of cards and set them aside.

3. Take out Jokers if you have them.

4. The remaining 50 playing cards to represent each participant in the study:
    - 14 face cards represent the people who yawn
    - 36 non-face cards represent the people who don't yawn.

### Running the simulation

1. Shuffle the 50 cards at least 7 times[^2] to ensure that the cards counted out are from a random process.

2. Count out the top 16 cards and set them aside. These cards represent the people in the control group. Count the number of face cards. This represents the number of people who yawned in the control group.

3. Out of the remaining 34 cards (treatment group) count the number of face cards. This represents the number of people who yawned in the treatment group.

4. Calculate the difference in proportions of yawners, $\hat{p}_{treatment} - \hat{p}_{control}$.

5. [Click here](https://forms.gle/f7rDK6ScLsu6AwB59) to report the difference you find.

If you finish early, repeat steps 1 - 5 to run the simulation again!
