# Learning Goals

In this lab you will...

-   Use simulation-based inference to draw conclusions about the association between two variables.
-  Describe simulation methods using words.

# Getting started

-   A repository has already been created for you and your teammates.
    Everyone in your team has access to the same repo.

-   Click [here](https://github.com/sta199-f21) to go to the course organization on GitHub.

-   You should see a repo with the **lab-07** prefix.

-   Each person on the team should clone the repository and open a new
    project in RStudio. Do not make any changes to the .Rmd file until
    the instructions tell you do to so.


# What makes a good burrito?

The goal of today's lab is to use simulation-based inference to assess what makes a good burrito. 

# The Data

Today's dataset has been adapted from Scott Cole's *Burritos of San Diego* 
project, located [**here**](https://srcole.github.io/100burritos/). The goal 
of the project was to identify the best and worst burritos in San Diego, 
characterize variance in burrito quality, and generate predictive models for 
what makes a burrito great. 

As part of this project, 71 participants reviewed burritos from 79 different 
taco shops. Reviewers captured objective measures of the burrito (such as 
whether it contains certain ingredients) and reviewed it on a number of metrics 
(such as quality of the tortilla, the temperature, quality of meat, etc.). For 
the purposes of this lab, you may consider each of these observations to be an
independent and representative sample of all burritos.

The subjective ratings in the dataset are as follows. Each variable is ranked
on a 0 to 5 point scale, with 0 being the worst and 5 being the best. 

- `tortilla`: quality of the tortilla
- `temp`: temperature of the burrito
- `meat`: quality of the meat
- `fillings`: quality of non-meat fillings
- `salsa`: quality of the salsa
- `mfr`: meat-to-filling ratio
- `uniformity`: whether each bite contains a uniform slew of ingredients (e.g.,
a bite entirely composed of tortilla and sour cream would probably be terrible)
- `synergy`: how well it all comes together

In addition, the reviewers noted the presence of the following burrito
components. Each of the following variables is a binary variable taking on 
values `present` or `none`:

- `guac`: guacamole
- `cheese`: cheese
- `fries`: fries (it's a thing, [look it up.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrito#San_Diego))
- `sourcream`: sour cream
- `rice`: rice
- `beans`: beans

The data are available in `burritos.csv`

# Exercises

## Instructions 

::: {.{commit}}
-   Use a small number of reps (about 100) as you write and test out
    your code. Once you have finalized all of your code, increase the
    number of reps to 10,000 to produce your final results.
-   Write your code and narrative in a reproducible way, so you can
    easily change the number of reps. For example, consider ways you can
    write your narrative using inline code, so the relevant values
    update when you change the number of reps.
-   Make sure we see all relevant code and output in the knitted PDF. If you use inline code, make sure we can still see the code used to derive that answer.
-   For each simulation exercise, use the seed specified in the
        exercise instructions.
-   All narrative should be written in full sentences, and
        visualizations should have clear title and axis labels.

1. Sour cream on burritos: yay or nay? Explain.

2. Suppose you are worried that the presence of sour cream adversely affects the uniformity of the burrito. You decide to conduct a hypothesis test to evaluate whether the  mean uniformity of burritos with sour cream is lower than burritos without sour cream. 

    - State the null and alternative hypotheses in words and mathematical notation. 
    -  Describe precisely how you would set up the simulation to construct the null distribution for this test. In your description, you can imagine using index cards to represent the data. Your description should also include specifics about the size of the sample drawn at each iteration and what statistic is calculated. You can assume the number of reps for the simulation is 10,000. (*Hint: Consider both how we've constructed the null distribution for difference in proportions and how we've constructed it for quantitative variables.* )

3. Construct the null distribution for this test using `set.seed(3)`.

    - Visualize the simulated null distribution and shade the area corresponding to the p-value. 
    - Then, calculate the p-value, and state your conclusion in the context of the data, using a significance level of 0.05.


4. Calculate and interpret a 90% confidence interval for the 
difference you investigated in Exercises 2 and 3. Use `set.seed(4)`.

5. Describe precisely how the simulation is set up to construct the bootstrap distribution used to calculate the confidence interval in Exercise 4. In your description, you can imagine using index cards to represent the data. Your description should also include specifics about the size of the sample drawn at each iteration and what statistic is calculated. You can assume the number of reps for the simulation is 10,000.

6. Your friend suggests that having sour cream and having guacamole on a burrito are dependent events. You decide to conduct a hypothesis test to assess your friend's claim. The hypotheses for the test are $H_0: p_{S} = p_{NS} \text{ vs. }H_a: p_{S} \neq p_{NS}$

    where $p_{S}$ is the proportion of burritos with sour cream that have guacamole and $p_{NS}$ is the proportion of burritos with no sour cream have guacamole

  
    - Construct the null distribution using `set.seed(6)`. Visualize the simulated null distribution and shade the area corresponding to the p-value. 
    - Then, calculate the p-value, and state your conclusion in the context of the data, using a significance level of 0.05.

7. Calculate and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the difference investigated in Exercise 6. Use `set.seed(7)`.

8. Create a new variable for overall burrito quality by taking the average scores for all ratings (tortilla quality, temperature, meat quality, etc.) in the dataset. *Is there evidence that burritos with guacamole have a different average overall perceived quality score compared to burritos without guacamole?* Evaluate this claim using a 99% confidence interval. Use `set.seed(8)`.

9. In the previous exercise, we've treated the rating variables as numeric variables. Evaluate the merits of this approach: is it appropriate? Could it potentially be misleading? Briefly explain.
