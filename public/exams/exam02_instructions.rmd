# STA 199: Exam 02

# Instructions

-   The exam questions are in the README portion of your repository on [the GitHub course organization page](https://github.com/sta199-f21).

-   This exam is due **Tuesday, November 16 at 11:59pm**.

-   You must submit a PDF document to Gradescope that corresponds to an
    `.Rmd` file on your GitHub repository in order to receive credit for
    this exam.

-   **With the exception of major emergencies, late submissions will not
    be accepted. Start and submit the exam early in order to avoid any
    last-minute technical issues. I must receive notification from your
    academic dean to accept a late submission.**

-   **You may resubmit the exam on Gradescope before the deadline.**

-   If a PDF is not uploaded to Gradescope by the submission deadline,
    your latest commit prior to the deadline will be used as your
    submission. There will be a penalty for failing to submit a PDF to
    Gradescope.

-   Commit and push often and at appropriate times. Part of your grade
    will be based on quality of commit history.

# Rules

-   This is an individual assignment. Everything in your repository is
    for your eyes only.
-   You may not collaborate or communicate anything about this exam to
    **anyone** except the instructor. For example, you may not
    communicate with other students, the TAs, or post/solicit help on
    the internet, email or via any other method of communication.
-   You may use `R` documentation, as well as course materials (notes
    and textbooks), or existing internet resources to answer exam
    questions.
-   You must cite any code you obtain outside of the course materials
    (notes and textbooks) you use as inspiration. A failure to cite is
    plagiarism. Cite any sources by providing a link to the original
    source in your exam write-up.
-   **No TA office hours will be held Thu, Nov 11 - Tue, Nov 16.** You may not email TAs
    questions about the exam.
-   If you have questions, email Prof. Fisher with "STA 199 Exam" in
    the subject line or attend office hours. **Prof. Fisher will have
    office hours during lecture on Tue, Nov 16**. Exam questions should only be about
    understanding the data or the exam's instructions. You may not ask
    questions on any topics from past assignments or material related to
    the exam.
-   Prof. Fisher will provide code debugging if needed, but this will
    result in a **grade penalty** reflecting the portion of the question
    where debugging occurred.

# Academic Integrity

By taking this exam, you pledge to uphold the Duke Community Standard:

-   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
-   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
-   I will act if the Standard is compromised.

# Submission

Upload the PDF document of the exam to Gradescope. Before you submit the
uploaded document, mark the pages associated with each exercise. If any
answer for an exercise spans multiple pages, mark all pages. Make sure
to associate the "Workflow & formatting" section with the first page.
**Failure to mark the pages in Gradescope may result in point
deductions.**

Make sure that your uploaded PDF document matches your `.Rmd` and the
PDF in your GitHub repository exactly. Points will be deducted for
documents that are not reproducible.
